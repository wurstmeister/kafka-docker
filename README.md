kafka-docker
============

Dockerfile for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)

The image is available directly from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka/)

## Pre-Requisites

- install docker-compose [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- modify the ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME``` in ```docker-compose.yml``` to match your docker host IP (Note: Do not use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the host ip if you want to run multiple brokers.)
- if you want to customize any Kafka parameters, simply add them as environment variables in ```docker-compose.yml```, e.g. in order to increase the ```message.max.bytes``` parameter set the environment to ```KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES: 2000000```. To turn off automatic topic creation set ```KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE: 'false'```
- Kafka's log4j usage can be customized by adding environment variables prefixed with ```LOG4J_```. These will be mapped to ```log4j.properties```. For example: ```LOG4J_LOGGER_KAFKA_AUTHORIZER_LOGGER=DEBUG, authorizerAppender```

## Usage

Start a cluster:

- ```docker-compose up -d ```

Add more brokers:

- ```docker-compose scale kafka=3```

Destroy a cluster:

- ```docker-compose stop```

## Note

The default ```docker-compose.yml``` should be seen as a starting point. By default each broker will get a new port number and broker id on restart. Depending on your use case this might not be desirable. If you need to use specific ports and broker ids, modify the docker-compose configuration accordingly, e.g. [docker-compose-single-broker.yml](https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker/blob/master/docker-compose-single-broker.yml):

- ```docker-compose -f docker-compose-single-broker.yml up```

## Broker IDs

You can configure the broker id in different ways

1. explicitly, using ```KAFKA_BROKER_ID```
2. via a command, using ```BROKER_ID_COMMAND```, e.g. ```BROKER_ID_COMMAND: "hostname | awk -F'-' '{print $2}'"```

If you don't specify a broker id in your docker-compose file, it will automatically be generated (see [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1070](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1070). This allows scaling up and down. In this case it is recommended to use the ```--no-recreate``` option of docker-compose to ensure that containers are not re-created and thus keep their names and ids.


## Automatically create topics

If you want to have kafka-docker automatically create topics in Kafka during
creation, a ```KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS``` environment variable can be
added in ```docker-compose.yml```.

Here is an example snippet from ```docker-compose.yml```:

        environment:
          KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "Topic1:1:3,Topic2:1:1:compact"

```Topic 1``` will have 1 partition and 3 replicas, ```Topic 2``` will have 1 partition, 1 replica and a `cleanup.policy` set to `compact`.

## Advertised hostname

You can configure the advertised hostname in different ways

1. explicitly, using ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME```
2. via a command, using ```HOSTNAME_COMMAND```, e.g. ```HOSTNAME_COMMAND: "route -n | awk '/UG[ \t]/{print $$2}'"```

When using commands, make sure you review the "Variable Substitution" section in [https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

If ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME``` is specified, it takes precedence over ```HOSTNAME_COMMAND```

For AWS deployment, you can use the Metadata service to get the container host's IP:
```
HOSTNAME_COMMAND=wget -t3 -T2 -qO-  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
```
Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html

## Broker Rack

You can configure the broker rack affinity in different ways

1. explicitly, using ```KAFKA_BROKER_RACK```
2. via a command, using ```RACK_COMMAND```, e.g. ```RACK_COMMAND: "curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone"```

In the above example the AWS metadata service is used to put the instance's availability zone in the ```broker.rack``` property.

## JMX

For monitoring purposes you may wish to configure JMX. Additional to the standard JMX parameters, problems could arise from the underlying RMI protocol used to connect

* java.rmi.server.hostname - interface to bind listening port
* com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port - The port to service RMI requests

For example, to connect to a kafka running locally (assumes exposing port 1099)

      KAFKA_JMX_OPTS: "-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=127.0.0.1 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=1099"
      JMX_PORT: 1099

Jconsole can now connect at ```jconsole 192.168.99.100:1099```

## Listener Configuration

Newer versions of Kafka have deprecated ```advertised.host.name``` and ```advertised.port``` in favor of a more flexible listener configuration that supports multiple listeners using the same or different protocols. This image supports up to three listeners to be configured automatically as shown below.

Note: if the below listener configuration is not used, legacy conventions for "advertised.host.name" and "advertised.port" still operate without change.

1. Use ```KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP``` to configure an INSIDE, OUTSIDE, and optionally a BROKER protocol. These names are arbitrary but used for consistency and clarity.
   * ```KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INSIDE:PLAINTEXT,OUTSIDE:SSL,BROKER:PLAINTEXT``` configures three listener names, but only the listener named OUTSIDE uses SSL. Note this example does not concern extra steps in configuring SSL on a broker.
2. Use ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PROTOCOL_NAME``` to set the name from the protocol map to be used for the "advertised.listeners" property. This is "OUTSIDE" in this example.
3. Use ```KAFKA_PROTOCOL_NAME``` to set the name from the protocol map to be used for the "listeners" property. This is "INSIDE" in this example.
4. Use ```KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_LISTENER_NAME``` to set the name from the protocol map to be used for the "inter.broker.listener.name". This defaults to ```KAFKA_PROTOCOL_NAME``` if not supplied. This is "BROKER" in the example.
5. Use ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT``` and ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME``` (or the ```HOSTNAME_COMMAND``` option) to set the name and port to be used in the ```advertised.listeners``` list.
6. Use ```KAFKA_PORT``` and ```KAFKA_HOST_NAME``` (optional) to set the name (optional) and port to be used in the ```listeners``` list. If ```KAFKA_HOST_NAME``` is not defined, Kafka's reasonable default behavior will be used and is sufficient. Note that ```KAFKA_PORT``` defaults to "9092" if not defined.
7. Use ```KAFKA_INTER_BROKER_PORT``` to set the port number to be used in both ```advertised.listeners``` and ```listeners``` for the Inter-broker listener. The host name for this listener is not configurable. Kafka's reasonable default behavior is used.

### Example

Given the environment seen here, the following configuration will be written to the Kafka broker properties.

```
HOSTNAME_COMMAND: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname
KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INSIDE:PLAINTEXT,OUTSIDE:PLAINTEXT
KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PROTOCOL_NAME: OUTSIDE
KAFKA_PROTOCOL_NAME: INSIDE
KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT: 9094
```

The resulting configuration:

```
advertised.listeners = OUTSIDE://ec2-xx-xx-xxx-xx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9094,INSIDE://:9092
listeners = OUTSIDE://:9094,INSIDE://:9092
inter.broker.listener.name = INSIDE
```

### Rules

* No listeners may share a port number.
* An advertised.listener must be present by name and port number in the list of listeners.
* You must not set "security.inter.broker.protocol" at the same time as using this multiple-listener mechanism.

### Best Practices

* Reserve port 9092 for INSIDE listeners.
* Reserve port 9093 for BROKER listeners.
* Reserve port 9094 for OUTSIDE listeners.

## Docker Swarm Mode

The listener configuration above is necessary when deploying Kafka in a Docker Swarm using an overlay network. By separating OUTSIDE and INSIDE listeners, a host can communicate with clients outside the overlay network while still benefiting from it from within the swarm.

In addition to the multiple-listener configuration, additional best practices for operating Kafka in a Docker Swarm include:

* Use "deploy: global" in a compose file to launch one and only one Kafka broker per swarm node.
* Use compose file version '3.2' (minimum Docker version 16.04) and the "long" port definition with the port in "host" mode instead of the default "ingress" load-balanced port binding. This ensures that outside requests are always routed to the correct broker. For example:

```
ports:
   - target: 9094
     published: 9094
     protocol: tcp
     mode: host
```

Older compose files using the short-version of port mapping may encounter Kafka client issues if their connection to individual brokers cannot be guaranteed.

See the included sample compose file ```docker-compose-swarm.yml```
