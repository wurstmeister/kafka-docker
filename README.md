kafka-docker
============

Dockerfile for [Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/)

The image is available directly from https://registry.hub.docker.com/

##Pre-Requisites

- install docker-compose [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- modify the ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME``` in ```docker-compose.yml``` to match your docker host IP (Note: Do not use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the host ip if you want to run multiple brokers.)
- or use ```ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME_SCRIPT``` to specify how to calculate the ```KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME```. This is very useful for situations where you won't know your server name until launching the Docker container. For example, running as an Amazon EC2 instance, ```curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname```
- if you want to customise any Kafka parameters, simply add them as environment variables in ```docker-compose.yml```, e.g. in order to increase the ```message.max.bytes``` parameter set the environment to ```KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES: 2000000```. To turn off automatic topic creation set ```KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE: 'false'```

##Usage

Start a cluster:

- ```docker-compose up -d ```

Add more brokers:

- ```docker-compose scale kafka=3```

Destroy a cluster:

- ```docker-compose stop```

##Note

The default ```docker-compose.yml``` should be seen as a starting point. By default each broker will get a new port number and broker id on restart. Depending on your use case this might not be desirable. If you need to use specific ports and broker ids, modify the docker-compose configuration accordingly, e.g. [docker-compose-single-broker.yml](https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker/blob/master/docker-compose-single-broker.yml):

- ```docker-compose -f docker-compose-single-broker.yml up```

##Broker IDs

If you don't specify a broker id in your docker-compose file, it will automatically be generated based on the name that docker-compose gives the container. This allows scaling up and down. In this case it is recommended to use the ```--no-recreate``` option of docker-compose to ensure that containers are not re-created and thus keep their names and ids.

If a broker id cannot be calculated with the above method, one will be generated as a function of nanoseconds since epoch and a random number. This has the problems outlined [here](https://kafka.apache.org/082/ops.html#basic_ops_cluster_expansion), but at least Kafka will be able to start.


##Automatically create topics

If you want to have kafka-docker automatically create topics in Kafka during
creation, a ```KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS``` environment variable can be
added in ```docker-compose.yml```.

Here is an example snippet from ```docker-compose.yml```:

        environment:
          KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "Topic1:1:3,Topic2:1:1"

```Topic 1``` will have 1 partition and 3 replicas, ```Topic 2``` will have 1 partition and 1 replica.
